============================== Description ===============================

It's no secret anymore, everyone wants an iPhone/iTouch compatible website.
While pretty much every website works on those devices without any code
modification being needed, that doesn't mean it's the best it can be.

prettyMobile is an iPhone/iTouch website development toolkit.
It provide you will all the basics you need to make a mobile version of
your website. It makes extensive use of CSS transformations making sure the
animations will be as smooth as they can be.
Plus, it's only 13kb gzipped and minified.

It's packaged with a CSS to give you the look and feel of a native
iPhone/iTouch application but by loading your own CSS file you can
really give it the look and feel you want.
